# PowerShellFun

You can learn a lot about programming if you have a purpose and a clear outcome in your head as
what you want to achieve. Creating games is a great way to have that clear goal. You can also learn 
a lot about powershell looking through the code in this github repo. 

This repo holds fun projects, generally games that can teach people lerning PowerShell
many things.

Structuring code, drawing elements on the screen at precise positions, getting keypress 
responses from people, and many more things are outlined in these games.
